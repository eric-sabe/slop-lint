# Changelog

Notable changes to the slop-lint tool and its tell catalogue. Format roughly follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); the package version and the catalogue
version move together.

## [0.9.0]

### Added

- **Allow-list config file.** Some content legitimately needs a catalogued word or phrase
  (a product named Tapestry, docs that must say "robust"). A `.slop-lint.json` in the
  working directory - `{ "allow": ["tapestry", "robust", "deep dive"] }` - is read
  automatically; `--config <file>` reads an explicit path instead, and a repeatable
  `--allow <entry>` flag adds one-offs on top. Each entry is written as it would appear
  in prose and disables every word/phrase rule its text triggers (case-insensitive), so
  flagged text can be pasted verbatim. Matching is per catalogue entry: allowing "delve"
  leaves "delves"/"delving" flagged. The typographic tells (em-dash, `--`, smart quotes,
  emoji) are never suppressed. A broken config stops the run with exit code 2; a missing
  one is fine, so zero-config stays the default. Programmatic: `lintText(text, { allow })`
  and a new `readConfig(path)` export.
- **23 structural phrase rules for AI comment-reply rhetoric.** Sourced from reply-bot
  specimens collected off social comment threads (two passes: pasted specimens, then a
  live feed-mining session), where the tells are constructions, not vocabulary.
  Validate-then-restate openers ("That is/That's the distinction.", "what you're
  describing / what you described", "you're right that", the "a sharp addition/point"
  compliment-open); contrast machinery (the uncontracted negated contrast "The danger
  isn't the X. It is the Y.", the noun-subject "X isn't the A, it's B", "doesn't X, it
  just Y", the "can X ... can't X" modal antithesis with a verb-echo backreference,
  "the real question/test" pivot, the "a tech problem, a change-management one" echo);
  aphorism molds ("is what keeps A from becoming B", "is measured by how", "as a
  hypothesis, not a promise", "lowers X without lowering Y", "True X requires/lies in",
  "the most important form of", "the uncomfortable question/truth", "will be those who"
  superlative prediction, "as an X rather than a Y" reframe); plus the "Which
  means/might" fragment opener, clause-initial "worth noting", and corrective anaphora
  with a verb echo ("nobody polices X, they police Y" / "don't mark X, they mark Y").
  Also widened 0.1.0's "not just X, but Y" to the "don't/doesn't just" forms, and added
  the words "resonated"/"resonating" (the "this really resonated" validate-open;
  inflection completion of 0.1.0's "resonate").
- **The specimen corpus and mold workflow.** New `corpus/specimens/` holds the
  reply-register specimens (as content-swapped skeletons: structure kept word-for-word,
  topic nouns replaced), `npm run specimens` (`specimen-coverage.mjs`) reports which lines
  the catalogue trips on and which are uncaught, and one-sighting molds wait in
  `corpus/specimens/PENDING.md` behind a two-independent-sightings bar (the
  document-frequency floor, applied by hand). Triage mode
  (`npm run specimens -- <harvest.txt>`) is the mining step: point it at freshly
  harvested comment text and it reports catalogue hits, pending-mold second sightings
  (via the `PENDING_MOLDS` mirror of PENDING.md), and uncaught candidate lines. In its
  first live run over a 21-comment feed thread it caught 11 of 28 lines and confirmed
  three shipped rules against unseen data ("you're describing" fired on its third
  independent thread). Every rule was screened against
  `corpus/baseline` to 0 false positives across ~60k words of oratory/explainer/
  journalism; the screen earned its keep twice - a loose negated-contrast draft fired on
  presidential speeches at the same rate as on model output (fixed by requiring an
  article after the negation, which also spares docs prose like "this field is not
  required. It is optional"), and a loose can/can't draft hit a MedlinePlus conditional
  ("If you cannot get...", fixed by excluding subordinators). Two rules are corroborated
  in `corpus/samples` ("Kyoto is not just a checklist of temples. It is a place...";
  "That's the promise we pour into every cup."). Specimen coverage: 15 of 16 lines
  flagged; a coverage-floor test guards against rule regressions.

## [0.8.0]

### Changed

- **Baseline is now three modern registers**, not just oratory (Perplexity-scouted, then
  endpoint-verified). `build-baseline.mjs` pulls: US presidential addresses (public domain,
  oratory), **NIH MedlinePlus** health summaries (public domain, plain-language explainer),
  and **Wikinews** (CC BY, journalism). All keyless and modern (~60k words).
- The plain explainer + journalism registers lowered the baseline's curly-quote rate to
  ~1.9 per 1k words, so GPT/Grok (~9) stand out ~4.7x - the smart-quote tell is now robustly
  validated. Claude/Grok also em-dash above this human baseline (7.x vs 4.2).

### Notes

- Sources evaluated and rejected: Federal Register (keyless, but jargon-dense regulatory
  boilerplate full of model numbers - bad prose); Voice of America (public domain, but no
  clean keyless API); SCOTUS (full text unreliable via free APIs). The honest constraint
  stands: genuinely casual modern prose is almost all copyrighted, so the best baseline you
  can add is your own contemporary writing.
- Even against the broader baseline, the vs-human word pass surfaced no new tells (only
  common words like "modern"/"rather"), so no catalogue change. The linter is unchanged.

## [0.7.0]

### Changed

- **Baseline is now modern public-domain US-government prose.** `build-baseline.mjs` pulls
  presidential State of the Union and Inaugural addresses (Ford..Biden, ~70k words) from
  Wikisource - public domain and contemporary, replacing the dated literary / CC-BY mix.
  This fixes the dated-vocabulary problem: the vs-human word comparison no longer throws up
  artifacts (e.g. "create" at 206x), and it sharpened the smart-quote signal - against the
  modern baseline (3.4 curly quotes per 1k words) GPT and Grok clearly stand out at ~9.

### Notes

- Supreme Court opinions were attempted (the request included them) but dropped: full text
  is unreliable via the free APIs (CourtListener lacks ingested text for many opinions;
  Wikisource transcludes opinions into subpages the extract API misses), and legalese is
  citation-noisy for a prose baseline. Speeches give a cleaner modern reference.
- Even with the modern baseline, the vs-human word pass surfaced no strong uncatalogued
  tells (only low-ratio common words like "often"/"modern"), confirming the catalogue
  already covers the obvious word tells. The em-dash stays ~5/1k even in oratory, so it
  remains a tell of plain typed text. Cross-model remains the most reliable signal.

## [0.6.0]

### Added

- **Smart/curly-quote warning.** Curly quotes and apostrophes (`“” ‘’`) are flagged as a
  generator/word-processor tell. Found empirically: three of four frontier models emit them
  in markdown output (GPT and Grok ~9 per 1k words) while one uses straight quotes.
- **`build-baseline.mjs`** (`npm run baseline`): assembles a human reference corpus for
  `--discover` from permissive sources - English Wikinews (CC BY 2.5) and public-domain
  Project Gutenberg books - with a `corpus/baseline/SOURCES.md` attribution file. Replaces
  the toy placeholder baseline (~43k words across 19 files).
- **`corpus-stats.mjs`** (`npm run stats`): punctuation/structure rates per corpus folder
  (em-dash, smart quotes, semicolons, ellipses, bold), surfacing typographic tells that
  the word-based `--discover` cannot see (e.g. GPT and Grok emit ~9 curly quotes per 1k
  words; Claude emits none).

### Notes

- Measuring punctuation against the baseline corrected an assumption: literary/typeset
  human prose (our Gutenberg baseline) uses the em-dash, curly quotes, and semicolons
  *heavily* too (~7, ~33, ~4 per 1k). So the em-dash is a tell of **plain modern typed
  text** (posts, email, markdown) - slop-lint's target - not of prose in general. The
  hard-fail stands for that target; the corpus does not "prove" it against literary prose.
- With a real (but partly dated, partly literary) baseline, the vs-human word comparison
  improved yet remains register-dominated (older prose under-uses modern words like
  "create"), so the reliable signal is still cross-model. A larger contemporary,
  plain-prose, genre-matched baseline would sharpen vs-human further.

## [0.5.0]

### Added

- **`incredibly`** to the catalogue, the first add sourced from this repo's own corpus
  discovery: one frontier model over-used it (in 7 of 24 answers) vs its peers on identical
  prompts. Source tagged `empirical: cross-model corpus discovery`.
- A real generated corpus under `corpus/samples/<model>/` (four current frontier models,
  24 prompts each) replaces the toy sample as the discovery input.

### Changed

- `--discover` is hardened against two artifacts the first real run exposed:
  - **Frontmatter is stripped** before tokenizing, so YAML keys (`model`, `prompt_id`)
    no longer rank as tells.
  - **Document-frequency floor** (`--min-docs`, default 3): a token must appear across
    multiple sample documents, which drops one-off artifacts (e.g. an invented product
    name repeated within a single answer) and keeps recurring style tells. The candidate
    report now shows a `docs` column.

### Notes

- Cross-model comparison (each model vs the pool of the others on the same prompts) is the
  reliable signal today, because topic is held constant. The vs-human comparison needs a
  larger, genre-matched human baseline to be trustworthy; the committed `corpus/baseline`
  is still a small placeholder.

## [0.4.1]

### Changed

- Model versions are now read from env vars (`ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, `OPENAI_MODEL`,
  `GEMINI_MODEL`, `XAI_MODEL`), so you bump a model version in `.env` without editing
  `models.json` or any code. `models.json` keeps the env-var name (`modelEnv`) and a
  fallback default. Added `.env.example` with the key and model vars.
- OpenAI adapter uses `max_completion_tokens` (required by gpt-5.x), and the default token
  budget is raised to 4000 so reasoning models leave room for a full-length answer.

## [0.4.0]

### Added

- **Sample generation harness.** `generate-samples.mjs` sends a fixed, genre-varied prompt
  set (`prompts.json`) to each model in `models.json` (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI; raw
  `fetch`, zero-dependency) and writes `corpus/samples/<model>/`. Key-gated and local-only
  (a model whose key env var is unset is skipped), so API keys never touch CI. Supports
  `--dry-run`, `--only`, and `--max`.
- **Per-model corpus + model-vs-pool comparison.** Samples live under
  `corpus/samples/<model>/`, and `--discover` now accepts a comma-separated list of folders
  for `--samples` / `--baseline`. Since every model answers the same prompts, a model can be
  compared against the pool of other models with topic held constant (its style signature),
  in addition to the model-vs-human comparison.

### Notes

- The committed `corpus/samples/example-llm` and `corpus/baseline` are illustrative only;
  generate real samples (and use a genre-matched human baseline) for real signal.

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- First reviewed pass from the catalogue-refresh sweep (sources: the Wikipedia "Signs of
  AI writing" essay plus practitioner blacklists). New words: bolster(s/ed/ing),
  groundbreaking, renowned, exemplifies, encompassing, enhance(s/d/ing), innovative,
  streamline(s/d) / streamlining, actionable, nestled. New phrases: "as an AI/large
  language model" and "I hope this helps" (assistant leakage), "in the heart of",
  "a diverse array of", "valuable insights", "stands/serves as a testament", "setting
  the stage for", "indelible mark", "deeply rooted in", "rich cultural heritage/tapestry".

### Changed

- `refresh.mjs` coverage check now also considers existing phrase rules, so candidates
  already covered by a `PHRASES` pattern (e.g. "in conclusion") are no longer reported.

### Rejected (kept out to avoid false positives)

- Words too common in ordinary writing to gate on: crucial, such as, overall, rich,
  featuring, align with, commitment to, ensuring, refers to.

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- **Sourced catalogue.** Words are grouped in `WORD_GROUPS`, each carrying a `since`
  version and a `source`, so entries can be pruned with confidence as tells fade.
  `slop-lint --list` prints the catalogue with its sources.
- **`--discover` mode.** Frequency analysis (words and bigrams) of model-output samples
  against a human baseline corpus; ranks over-represented, not-yet-catalogued tokens as
  candidate new tells. This is how the original "delve" tell was found, and it re-runs
  against each new model's output. Example corpus under `corpus/`.
- **`--version` flag** and an exported `VERSION` constant.
- **Self-contained monthly catalogue refresh.** `refresh.mjs` assembles candidates from
  corpus discovery plus the public Wikipedia "Signs of AI writing" essay (coverage diff),
  and `.github/workflows/catalogue-refresh.yml` files the report as a GitHub issue for
  human review. No secrets or external services.

### Notes

- Catalogue content is unchanged from 0.1.0; this release adds provenance and the tooling
  to keep the list current as models evolve.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Initial release. Em-dash hard-fail (exit 1) plus warnings on ~60 focal/marketing words,
  ~35 cliche phrases and constructions, double-hyphen em-dash substitutes, and emoji.
  Single-file zero-dependency CLI, importable exports (`lintText`, `walkFiles`, `WORDS`,
  `PHRASES`), tests, and CI.
